# Verus Retreat @ Secure Foundations Lab, CMU -- June 25-27 2024

We are organizing a retreat for people involved in the Verus project.
Bryan Parno (@parno) and the Secure Foundations Lab will be hosting the retreat at CMU during the week of June 24th.

We are planning 3 days of "official" semi-structured time (Tuesday the 25th through Thursday the 27th), but there will likely be informal meet-ups, discussion, and hacking the Monday before (6/24) and the Friday after (6/28).

Sessions will begin at 9:30 AM.  We will be meeting in the [Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC)](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/about/visiting.html), room 2101.
